I am a computational biologist. I have commercial experience in python programming and in machine learning.

My industry experience is applying machine learning methods and statistics for analyzing omics data and computer vision methods for cryo-EM data analysis. In addition, I have experience teaching statistics and machine learning for students of biology and medicine.

My primary goal is to continue to develop my skills in the field of AI/ML/DL applied to biology.
